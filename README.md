All Purpose Dashboard that leverages the RShiny UI allowing for modelling and statistical analysis without in depth R experience.

- Allows user to filter data on up to 10 qualitative sets. 
- Can handle up to 2 GB of raw data. 
- Monte Carlo Simulation includes bootstrap, triangular and normal.
- Note : For Monte Carlo best practice is to use the bootstrap to generate the mean and standard deviation, then plug those values into the Normal Distribution function.
- GGPlot functionality includes sum and mean, allows user to generate bar charts of quantitive data on qualitative descriptors.
- Predictive Modelling allows user to view the accuracy and breakpoints within the generated model, additionally, generates the graphics related to RSq and GRsq values.
- MARS modelling gives an excel equation output below.
- MARS functionality allows for imputation or omitting missing data.
